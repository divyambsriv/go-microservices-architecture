# Go Microservices Architecture

A backend microservices architecture built with Go, utilizing Redis for data storage and the Chi router for HTTP routing.

### Overview

This project demonstrates a scalable and maintainable microservices architecture in Go. It includes:

- **HTTP Server**: Configurable port for serving API requests.
- **Redis Integration**: Redis used for storing and managing order data.
- **Order Management**: Endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting orders.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper handling of OS interrupts for safe shutdown.
